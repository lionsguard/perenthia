    <h1>A Brief History of Perenthia</h1>
    <div>
        Written accounts of the time before the Dark War have all but vanished save for
        the few scrolls that still remain in the Royal Library of Angarath. What is generally
        known is that in the time before the War there ruled seven great wizards; Birjii,
        Lelvetor, Incarin, Hilgric, Vendia, Kulnar and Elerosh. They ruled the various regions
        of Perenthia and maintained peace and prosperity among the denizens.</div>
    <div>
        &nbsp;</div>
    <div>
        Kulnar, always seeking the dark knowledge, stumbled upon an ancient tome wherein
        was described a means to open a portal to the underworld and thereby gain control
        of the creatures that live within. Against the urging of his fellow wizards Kulnar
        followed the instructions in the tome and opened a great Chasm into the underworld,
        unleashing the foul minions upon mankind. The spell claimed Kulnar&rsquo;s life
        and the lives of Lelvetor and Incarin who where present at the time and attempted
        to stop Kulnar.</div>
    <div>
        &nbsp;</div>
    <div>
        In the years that followed, all humankind, aided by the remaining five wizards,
        were thrust into a battle for survival. For over fifty years the Dark War raged
        on with the creatures from the underworld always gaining strength and claiming more
        and more territory, consuming anything in their path.&nbsp;</div>
    <div>
        &nbsp;</div>
    <div>
        The remaining five wizards had learned of a counter spell that could close the Chasm
        and journeyed together into the Spline Mountains to perform the ritual. Being the
        great wizards that they were they were able to close the Chasm but sacrificed their
        lives to do so.</div>
    <div>
        Since the closing of the Chasm over one hundred years ago mankind has sought to
        destroy the remaining minions of the underworld and finally cleanse the land of
        the darkness. Lately though, rumors have begun circulating, from prospectors and
        minors of the Spline Mountains, that a constant darkness is beginning to settle
        over the mountains and the demons who live in the dark places are becoming restless.
        It is even rumored that a Dragon has been seen around the small village of Delcor
        on the eastern border of the Spline Mountains.</div>
    <div>
        &nbsp;</div>
    <div>
        It is feared that perhaps the Chasm was not completely sealed and has started to
        weaken and open again. As such the greatest minds of the New Alliance have begun
        to recruit adventurers that will undertake the tasks of finding the lost knowledge
        and ensuring the Chasm is closed and stays closed.</div>
